> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using a screen reader for accessibility testing, your goal is to detect problems in your code that interfere with the usage of your website or app, not to emulate the experience of a screen reader user. Remember that using an AT to test code against a set of rules and asking users about their experience often yields different results. Both are important aspects to create fully inclusive products.
