**_Pros_**

-   Catches more issues then automated testing
-   Fewer tools and expertise needed

**_Cons_**

-   More complex and time consuming
-   Difficult to repeat at scale
-   Sometimes requires greater expertise to run test and interpret results

### Can be automated

-   Color contrast of text on solid backgrounds
-   Image alternative text exists
-   Headings, lists, and landmarks exist
-   ARIA is present
-   Identifying keyboard-focusable elements
-   iFrame title detection
-   Video element is present

### Can't be automated

-   Headings, lists, and landmarks are correctly marked-up and all elements are accounted for
-   ARIA is being used appropriately and applied to the correct element(s)
