# Typography

-   Font variations, size, spacing andkerning all play a part in being able to process text.

## Typeface

-   Use common fonts/ typefaces, greater experience with common typefaces means easier reading for certain people
-   Avoid orante/ cursive/ handwritten typefaces, they may look nice tbut they arent good for people with reading disabilities
-   Be careful with letter spacing, some letter combinations that are too close will mean they may be combined in the readers head.

    -   eg: r n = m
    -   common letter pattens can be difficult for some people eg: `b / d`, `p / q`, `f / t`, `i / j`, `m / w` and `n / u`

-   Try to use common font faces with unique characters for things like i,l and 1

-   Try to use common font sizes and try to avoid italic fonts. Too small text or certain italic fonts may make it harder to read

[!IMPORTANT]
**_ use `rem` for font sizing, this will make the font size relative to the browser settings _**

-   Best practice is to use asterisks, dashes, or highlighting to emphasize words if needed

## Structure and layout

-   Make sure layouts are not overly ocmplex or cluttered.
-   Make sure critical elements of the page are distinct and that separate elements have clear definition
-   Make sure text blocks are not super long(wide) keep text blocks more narrow for a better reading experience

-   You can use [Good line-height](https://thegoodlineheight.com/) or [Golden ratio typography](https://grtcalculator.com/) to check your text blocks to make sure they are more accessible

-   Use layouts like headings, subheadings, lists, numbers, quote blocks and other visual blockings to divide the page into sections to make it easier to read
-   Use defined paragraphs, sentences and word spacing
-   Best max width for text is 80 characters wide, 40 for logograms
-   Avoid justified text alignment that create 'rivers of space'
