# Video and audio

## Alternate media types

-   Types of media to include with th media files depends on a couple things

    -   Type of media you're supporting eg audio-only, video-only, video with audio etc
    -   If its live or prerecorded
    -   The level of WCAG you're targeting
    -   Any additional needs that might need meeting

    -   Four main types
        -   Captions
        -   Transcripts
        -   Audio descriptions
        -   Sign language interpretation

## Captions

    -   Synced to the playing media
    -   Presented in the playing language
    -   includes non-speech info like sound effects, background noises and essential music

    -   2 types

        -   Closed captions (CC) : text on top of a video that can be toggled
        -   Open captions (OC) : text burned into the video that cannot be toggled

        -   Subtitles are not the same as captions, subtitles are usually just visual text for people who can hear the audio track, captions also capture important context in sound

## Transcriptions

-   Similar to captions but are useful for people who may want o review the content at their own speed.
-   Typically more detailed that captions though
    -   Time efficient to create captions and then export them to create your transcript
-   Good to incude transcripts with meda files for SEO, can be crawled for info. Captions cannot
-   Make sure than transcripts are always available and accessible
    -   Include the transcript alongside the video in the content of the page
    -   Link to an accessible PDF with the transcript or a copy on another page
    -   Link to the transcript from the description of the video

## Audio descriptions

-   Uses a narrator to describe what's happening on screen

    -   Includes non verbal info like expression, unspoken actions and background information

-   If there is too much detail to cover extended descrpiton can be included, this will pause the video to convey all the needed info

## Sign language interpretation

-   Narrator will interperate in sign language
-   Can be expensive and time consuming
-   Not always the best option as there are so many different types of sign language
